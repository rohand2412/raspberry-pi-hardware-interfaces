# Raspberry Pi Hardware Interfaces

This repository houses the test cases/example code for [this raspberry pi library](https://gitlab.com/rohand2412/raspberry_pi_libraries)'s `serial_Wrapper` class. The test cases are written to stress test the classes and make use of as many methods from the `serial_Wrapper` class as they can. Feel free to use these programs as a precursor to bug test any pull requests for that library.

## Getting Started

The following instructions will get you completely set up:
